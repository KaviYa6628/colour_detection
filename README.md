# Tracking Using HSV

In this Example I tried to track objects with blue colors. (Red is life ðŸ˜Ž).

I used Trackbars to manipulate the values for red  range, the following results are expressed in terms of `lowerValue(71,112,112)` up to `(255,255,255)`.

## Required Modules :

- **Numpy**

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
```


## Output explanation
I have tried to detect red colour in this code.My red bottle is detected.you can change the colour by adjusting the trackbar HSV (colours)values.I also added a beep sound if that particular colour is detected.
